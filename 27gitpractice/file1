What is DevOps? Why Is It Important?
Probably you have seen hundreds of different definitions of DevOps by now. For me, DevOps is a set of best practices around the software development lifecycle and the effort to continually improve and deliver value more efficiently.  

On its basis, DevOps is a culture that spreads equally between developers and operations rather than a specific role. In reality, the term has been used as an umbrella term to characterize the engineering roles of cloud-savvy people who share the pains and responsibilities of devs and ops. At the same time, they strive to enable and promote DevOps practices within organizations. 

So why all this fuss? Implementing these practices has proven to improve software quality. Different software and operations teams collaborate more efficiently, reduce friction and lead time, integrate and test their code continuously, and deploy more often.
